Add JavaScript redirects from one page to another

== Description ==

JS Redirect allows you to setup redirects from one page to another. They are client side so that they are not cached by browsers like Chrome which can be a bit to agressive with 3XX redirects. This will also preserve utm_source and other analytics tracking even if there is a server cache that caches the processed html/php.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/js-redirect` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Select a page to edit.
3. Select a page to redirect to.
